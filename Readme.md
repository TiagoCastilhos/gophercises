# Go exercises

This is the resolution of Gophercises course exercises available in [Go Courses by Jon Calhoun](https://courses.calhoun.io/). The course is free, and if just like me you want to get started with Go, I would recommend you to give it a chance for this one. I will a basic description for every exercise once I finish it.

### Exercise 1 - Quiz game

The first exercise is a quiz game that reads a CSV file with questions and answers and the user will be asked to answer those questions. The quiz has a time limit, and once it reaches this limit user will no longer be able to answer questions. The total score will be displayed when all questions are answered or when time's out.
